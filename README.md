# SPA-GULP
This project consists of a Single Page Application (SPA) developed using the Gulp tool. The application was created with the goal of providing users with a seamless navigation experience, without the need to reload the page for each content change.

To achieve this goal, technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used, as well as several automated tasks with Gulp, such as file minification and image optimization.
